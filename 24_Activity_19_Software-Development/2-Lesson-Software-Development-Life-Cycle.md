## Software Development Life Cycle

Large projects are managed by being divided into the stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

There are several versions of the SDLC. For the Cumulative Task, you will be following these five stages.

Stage 1: Analysis
* Receive software requirements from the client.
* Discuss ideas from other team members.
* Divide up the work and and assign roles (project manager, head programmer, graphic artist). 
* Create a scope document.

Stage 2: Design and Development
* Prepare a feasibility study.
* Create a project schedule with deadlines for subtasks.
* Create flowcharts for complex algorithms.
* Create a UML diagram with all the custom classes.

Stage 3: Implementation
* Produce code for the application.
* Maintain a project log.
* Produce a user guide.

Stage 4: Testing
* Individual program testing.

Stage 5: Maintenance
* Review the project log.
*  Prepare a report documenting the success and challenges while creating your application.
* Complete a reflection report documenting the successes, challenges, and limitations of your work.

There are various SDLC models that indicate how many times and in what order these steps are executed.

You will be using the Prototype Model, which involves repeating the cycle once to create a prototype, then revisiting the steps to enhance the program.
