Exercise 4-9 Solutions

1. What is the difference betweenÂ System.out.print and System.out.println?

System.out.println prints a line separator at the end, whereas System.out.print does not.

For example, the following code would print 1 and 2 on separate lines and BUILD SUCCESSFUL would appear on the following line.

System.out.println(1);
System.out.println(2); 

On the other hand, the following code whereas would print "12" and is immediately followed by BUILD SUCCESSFUL (i.e. 12BUILD SUCCESSFUL).

System.out.print(1);
System.out.print(2);
